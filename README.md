# 🔍 Binary Search Visualization  

This project is an interactive visualization of the **Binary Search algorithm**, built to make the concept easier to understand through step-by-step animations. It shows how the search space is divided, highlights the midpoint element, and demonstrates comparisons until the target is found or declared missing.  

## ✨ Features  
- Step-by-step visualization of the algorithm  
- Color-coded highlights for left, right, and mid elements  
- Real-time updates as the search progresses  
- User input for custom arrays and target values  
- Simple, intuitive interface for learners  

## 🎯 Purpose  
Binary Search is one of the most efficient searching algorithms, but its divide-and-conquer approach can be tricky for beginners to visualize. This project turns abstract logic into an interactive learning experience.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-search-visualization.git
